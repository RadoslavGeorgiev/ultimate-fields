Easy and powerful custom fields management: Post Meta, Options Pages, Repeaters and many field types!

== Description ==

With Ultimate Fields you can easily create fields in the admin. Those fields can be displayed when you are editing a post or page (any post type actually) or in an options page (ex. Theme Options) anywhere in the admin.

Please visit [https://www.ultimate-fields.com/](https://www.ultimate-fields.com/) for more details.

= Features =
* Easy to use.
* Various field types (listed below)
* Support for Post Type and Options Page as locations for fields. All locations have advanced placement rules, in order to only show them when needed.
* WYSIWYG Field Creation
* Focused on developers: A clean object-oriented API allows you to cleanly define all of your fields through code.
* Perfected tabs, alignment and styles
* Import, Export and in-theme JSON Synchronization
* JavaScript-based interface
* Unlimited field nesting with the Repeater and Complex fields
* Conditional Logic between fields in the same container (and ones on upper levels)
* REST API Support
* Admin Columns
* Integration with WordPress SEO for automatic field content ratings
* Clean styles: Ultimate Fields follows WordPress' built in styles as much as possible and provides a seamless experience. It's even fully responsive.
* Full-featured interface for data loading

= Fields =
* Text
* Textarea
* WYSIWYG Editor
* Password
* Number
* Checkbox
* Select
* Multiselect
* Image-Select (a visual select)
* File
* Image
* WP Object (for selection of an object among posts, terms and users)
* WP Objects (for multiple objects)
* Link
* Section
* Tab
* Complex
* Repeater

= Repeaters =
Repeaters can be used to add repeatable groups of fields. You can combine a text and a file field into a Slide group and allow the user to add as many slides as he needs. The value is saved in a single field!

Additionally you can add different types of groups into a single repeater. This way the user could add both Video Slides and Image Slides through the same place.

= Embedding in themes and plugins =
Ultimate Fields has all the necessary logic built in. Just place it wherever you need and include ultimate-fields.php


== Installation ==

1. Upload `ultimate-fields` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You are ready to create your first container. To do this, choose "Add New" from the "Ultimate Fields" section in the menu.
4. Output values through get_value(), the_value() and etc.

Please make sure to check out [the documentation on our website](https://www.ultimate-fields.com/docs/).

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 3.0 =
This is a complete rewrite of the plugin with renewed interface and various new functions. After upgrade, you will be required to migrate your containers to the format of the new version. Important: There are no immediate modifications of field values and the old container format will be stored in case you need to revert.

== Changelog ==

[FIX] Limiting preview image sizes to 100% to ensure that if `thumbnail` is not available as an image size, images are not overflowing.
[FIX] Enqueueing overlays properly for files: The File fields were expecting the Overlay JS class to be available, but it was not enqueued.
[FIX] Values are now properly saved and loaded for WYSIWYG editors, including empty paragraphs and etc.
[FIX] Improved handling of repeater values in the REST API: The iterator format of the repeater field was not playing nicely with the REST API.
[UPDATE] Minor adjustments of the UI and complex fields in order to allow https://github.com/RadoslavGeorgiev/ultimate-fields-layout-control to work.
[FIX] Messages are not saving values anymore.
[FIX][W2422] Conditional logic is not used if unchecked
